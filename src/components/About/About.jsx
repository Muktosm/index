          <p>
            Cognito was founded in 2018 by Amadeus & Tom, on the belief that
            education plays a vital role in providing opportunities and
            improving wellbeing for people everywhere. We're on a mission to
            redefine what students expect from digital learning materials, and
            to create resources that are not only expertly-curated, but
            beautiful to look at and fun to use.As of 2023 the Cognito team has
            grown to almost ten people, and we're currently hard at work
            expanding the range of academic years and exam boards we cover.
